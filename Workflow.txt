28/10/2021 -- Project start:

Decided to program a Hitscan weapon as one of six projects for a university module.

Created SurvivalGameCharacter class inheriting from ACharacter UE4 class.
Declared and initialized UCameraComponent and USpringArmComponent as well as several public and protected member functions && variables.

Hooked up various axis functions related to movement:
MoveForward(float Value), MoveRight(float Value)

Hooked up various Action Functions related to Combat:
StartFire(), CeaseFire(), BeginCrouch(), EndCrouch(), Fire(), Jump()

Implemented the built in Event binding within the PlayerInputComponent->SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent) 
using the BindAxis and BindAction delegates.


Created SurvivalWeapon class inheriting from AActor UE4 class.
Declared and initialized USkeletalMeshComponent and several public and protected member functions && variables.

Most importantly:
struct FHitScanTrace containing the information of a single hitscan weapon linetrace:
TEnumAsByte<EPhysicalSurface>, FVector_NetQuantize.

Initialize TimeBetweenShots in SurvivalWeapon->BeginPlay(). Variable is accessible in class defaults to allow for adjustments in each individual child.
SurvivalWeapon->StartFire(), SurvivalWeapon->CeaseFire() Create and destroy a looping timer calling SurvivalWeapon->Fire() respectively

Built the LineTraceSingleByChannel(Hit, EyeLocation, TraceEnd, COLLISION_WEAPON, QueryParams) in SurvivalWeapon->Fire(). 

Called SurvivalWeapon* CurrentWeapon->StartFire(), CurrentWeapon->CeaseFire() in SurvivalGameCharacter->StartFire(), SurvivalGameCharacter->CeaseFire().

Declared ParticleSystems in SurvivalWeapon (set in editor).
Initialized PlayImpactEffects(EPhysicalSurfaceType, FVector ImpactPoint) && PlayeFireEffects(FVectorTraceEnd) to Spawn article effects.

Checked LineTrace works (INSERTLINKTOYOUTUBEVIDEO).

Created Repo before adding ParticleEffects.
